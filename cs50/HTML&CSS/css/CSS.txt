*CHAPTER TEN: CSS*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Introducing CSS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.
- A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration
- Selectors: indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.
- Declarations: indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two 
parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon

- Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.
- Values specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. 

- <link>: The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. it lives inside the <head> element. It should use three attributes:
. href: This specifies the path to the CSS file (which is often placed in a folder called css or styles).
. type: This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.
. rel: This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file

***An HTML page can use more than one CSS style sheet. To do this it could have a <link>element for every CSS file it 
uses. For example, some authors use one CSS file to control the presentation (such as fonts and colors) and a second to control the layout.***

<style>: You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element, which usually sits inside the <head> element of the page. The <style> element should use the type attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in CSS. The value should be text/css.
- When building a site with more than one page, you should use an external CSS style sheet. This:
● Allows all pages to use the same style rules (rather than repeating them in each page).
● Keeps the content separate from how the page looks.
● Means you can change the styles used across all pages by altering just one file (rather than each individual page)

- If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element, it is important to understand which will take precedence. 
. LAST RULE: If the two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take precedence.
. SPECIFICITY: If one selector is more specific than the others, the more specific rule will take precedence over more general ones.
h1 is more specific than *
p b is more specific than p
p#intro is more specific than p
. IMPORTANT: You can add !important after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element.

- if you specify the font-family or color properties on the <body> element, they will apply to most child elements. This is because the value of the font-family property is inherited by child elements.


*CHAPTER ELEVEN: Colour*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	intro
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
. rgb values: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
. hex codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
. color names: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.


*CHAPTER TWELVE: TEXT*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	intro
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The people who are visiting your site need the typeface you have specified installed on their computer in order for it to be displayed. 
- You can specify a list of fonts separated by commas so that, if the user does not have your first choice of typeface installed, the browser can try to use an alternative font from the list.
- It is also common to end with a generic font name for that type of font
- pages usually look better if they use no more than three typefaces on a page.

-  There are several ways to specify the size of a font. The most common are:
. pixels
. percentages: The default size of text in browsers is 16px. So a size of 75% would be the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px.
. ems: An em is equivalent to the width of a letter m

- font-weight: The font-weight property allows you to create bold text. There are two values that this property commonly takes:
. normal: This causes text to appear at a normal weight.
. bold: This causes text to appear bold.

- font-style: If you want to create italic text, you can use the font-styleproperty. There are three values this property can take:
. normal: This causes text to appear in a normal style (as opposed to italic or oblique).
. italic: This causes text to appear italic.
. oblique: This causes text to appear oblique.

- text-transform: The text-transform property is used to change the case of text giving it one of the following 
values:
. uppercase: This causes the text to appear uppercase.
. lowercase: This causes the text to appear lowercase.
. capitalize: This causes the first letter of each word to appear capitalized.

- text-decoration: The text-decoration property allows you to specify the following values:
. none: This removes any decoration already applied to the text
. underline: This adds a line underneath the text.
. overline: This adds a line over the top of the text.
. line-through: This adds a line through words.
. blink: This animates the text to make it flash on and off

- line-height: spacing between words in different lines, it is set in em.

- line-spacing, word-spacing: both measured in em.

- text-align: he text-align property allows you to control the alignment of text. The property can take one of four values:
. left: This indicates that the text should be left-aligned.
. right: This indicates that the text should be right-aligned
. center: This allows you to center text.
. justify: This indicates that every line in a paragraph, except the last line, should be set to take up the full 
width of the containing box.

- vertical align: It is more commonly used with inline elements such as <img>, <em>, or <strong> elements. 

- text-indent: It can take a negative value, which means it can be used to push text off the browser window; you want the text there to be visible for search engines and blind people but not seen in the page

- text-shadow: The first length indicates how far to the left or right the shadow should fall.The second value indicates the distance to the top or bottom that the shadow should fall.The third value is optional and specifies the amount of blur that should be applied to the drop shadow.The fourth value is the color of the drop shadow.

:first-letter, :first-line: these are pseudo elements

- :link, :visited: 
:link: This allows you to set styles for links that have not yet been visited. 
:visited: This allows you to set styles for links that have been clicked on. 

- :hover, :active, :focus
:hover: This is applied when a user hovers over an element with a pointing device such as a mouse. 
:active: This is applied when an element is being activated by a user; for example, when a button is being pressed or a link being clicked. 
:focus: This is applied when an element has focus. Any element that you can interact with, such as a link you can click on or any form control can have focus.
- When pseudo-classes are used, they should appear in this order: :link, :visited, :hover, :focus, :active.


*CHAPTER THIRTEEN: BOXES*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	intro
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- width, height: By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

- min-width, max-width: Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

- min-height, max-height: In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want 
to limit the height of it. This is achieved using the min-heightand max-height properties.

- overflow: The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
. hidden: This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
. scroll: This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.

- border-width: The border-width property is used to control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given in pixels or using one of the following values:
thin
medium
thick
- (You cannot use percentages with this property.)You can control the individual size of borders using four 
separate properties:
border-top-width
border-right-width
border-bottom-width
border-left-width
You can also specify different widths for the four border values in one property, like so:
border-width: 2px 1px 1px 2px;
The values here appear in clockwise order: top, right, bottom, left.

- You can specify the color of a border using either RGB values, hex codes or CSS color names

- The border property allows you to specify the width, style and color of a border in one property (and the values should be coded in that specific order).

- padding: The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.
- The value of the padding property is not inherited by child elements in the same way that the color value of the font-family property is; so you need to specify the padding for every element that needs to use it.

- margin: The value of the padding property is not inherited by child elements in the same way that the color value of the font-family property is; so you need to specify the padding for every element that needs to use it.	

- If you want to center a box on the page (or center it inside the element that it sits in), you can set the left-margin and right-margin to auto.
- In order to center a box on the page, you need to set a width for the box (otherwise it will take up the full width of the page)

- The text-align property is inherited by child elements. You therefore also need to specify the text-align property on the centered box if you do not want the text inside it to be centered.

- display: The display property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page.
