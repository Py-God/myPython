- Data is used everywhere 
- how is data stored?; in a database

- Database is a program that helps store data and has functionalities for adding, modifing and querying that data

- Relational database (a type of database): stores data in a table e.g excel spreadsheet
- databases come with a query language to interact with the database. SQL is designed for accessing database


- CREATE TABLE [tablename] (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, );
- we always need unique ids for each row in a database id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY signals to the database that each row must have a unique identifier

- to add values to a database table use
INSERT INTO [tablename] VALUES (idValue, nameValue, quantityValue); in that format


- to form any query use 'SELECT'
	SELECT [column name] FROM [tablename];
	SELECT * FROM [tablename]; - to get all the column names
	SELECT * FROM [tablename] ORDER BY [columnname]; - specifies what column you want to order by
	SELECT * FROM [tablename] WHERE [columnname] > 5; - specifies what specific column name attributes you want

- an aggregate function in SQL is useful in getting the maximun, minimum, sum etc of values in our database
to use:
	SELECT SUM(columnname) FROM [tablename]; - getting sum of an integer column
	SELECT MAX(columnname) FROM [tablename]; - getting the max column integer 
	SELECT [aggfunction](columnname) FROM [tablename] GROUP BY [columnname]; - getting how many items we will get in 	column name for repeating column names
	SELECT [columnname], [aggfunction](columnname) FROM [tablename] GROUP BY [columnname];


DATABASE TUTORIAL
- A database is a program that allows for the storage and retrieval of data. Broadly speaking there are two types of databases: relational and non-relational.

- The “id” column is what’s known as a primary key: a unique and non-null number that refers to each record. Every record/row in a relational table has a primary key.
