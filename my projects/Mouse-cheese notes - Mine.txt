The game works so...
- there would be a random word assigned per play. when you guess a word right from the word, the mouse moves closer to a target(cheese)
  if you make a wrong guess, the mouse moves closer to a trap.

- depending on the amount of letters in the word, the amount of tiles the mouse will move will be determined

	Trap______mouse______cheese
- right guess: Trap______mouse____cheese
- wrong guess: Trap____mouse______cheese
	The distance btw Trap and Cheese has to be like x2 of the len(word)
this project is similar to the hangman project. You'll have to use it as a reference.



				Actual code

-  starting with the imports. i would choose random and time like the hangman
